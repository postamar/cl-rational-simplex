Quick solver instructions:
--------------------------

1. Create LP object instance
- either enerate new LP object instance with lp-make-new,
- or load from MPS file with lp-load-from-mps

2. Modify
- add new constraint with lp-add-constraint
- add new variable with lp-add-variable
(adding all constraints before adding all variables is most efficient)

3. Solve
- if desired and in single-threaded mode (i.e. +thread-system+ is NIL),
	run single-threaded-profiling to enable profiling of important functions
- run lp-solve to find an optimal basis

4. Analyze
- get primal solution values with lp-primal-solution and lp-slack-values
- get dual solution values wih lp-dual-solution and lp-reduced-costs


Function arguments and return values are documented more extensively in their doc strings.
